# TS Interop Shim

This project allows connection with Typescript plugins (as well as, in theory, plugins written in any other language with STDIO and JSON serialisation).
To begin:
1. Build this project.
1. Copy the dll to your server folder.
1. Create a `ts-shim-settings.json` file in that folder.
1. Populate the file with an object implementing the `Settings` interface.
1. Run the server, enable the plugin, and see if it works!
